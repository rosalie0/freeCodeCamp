// Setup
const myArray = [];
let i = 10;

// Only change code below this line

// Do ... While loop
// It is called a do...while loop because it will:
// - do one pass of the code inside the loop no matter what
// -  then continue to run the loop while the specified condition evaluates to true.

// TASK: Change the while loop in the code to a do...while loop so:
// the loop will push only the number 10 to myArray,
// and i will be equal to 11 when your code has finished running.
