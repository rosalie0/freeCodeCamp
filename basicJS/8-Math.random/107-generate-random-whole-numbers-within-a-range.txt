  // Only change code below this line
  // TASK: Create a function called randomRange that:
  // - takes a range myMin and myMax and 
  // - returns a random whole number that's greater than or equal to myMin
  // - and is less than or equal to myMax, inclusive.

  // this is a number that is in the range 0 to max-min
  const n = Math.floor(Math.random() * (myMax-myMin+1))
  // we then use +min to offset it into the range of min to max
  return n + myMin;
