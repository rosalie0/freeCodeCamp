// Accessing Object Properties with Variables
// Another use of bracket notation on objects is to access a property which is stored as the value of a variable.
// This can be very useful for iterating through an object's properties or when accessing a lookup table.

// Set the playerNumber variable to 16. Then, use the variable to look up the player's name and assign it to player.
const playerNumber = 16;  // Change this line
const player = testObj[playerNumber];   // Change this line
